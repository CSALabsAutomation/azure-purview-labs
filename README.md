# Azure-Purview-Labs

## What is Azure Purview?
Azure Purview is a data governance service that helps you manage and govern your data landscape. 
By connecting to data across your on-premises, multi-cloud, and software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources, Purview creates an up-to-date map of your information. 
It identifies and classifies sensitive data and provides end to end linage.
Data consumers can discover data across your organization, and data administrators are able to audit, secure, and ensure the right use of your data.
