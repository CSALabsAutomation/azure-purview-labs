> ⚠️ Since we have not scanned the assets with sensitivity labels, we cannot view the sensitivity insights for this demo.

    **Sensitivity labels** state how **sensitive** data is in your organization.

    **Classifications** on the other hand indicate the **type** of data values (e.g. Driver's License Number, Email Address, SWIFT Code, etc).
    Microsoft Purview's ability to apply sensitivity labels is controlled within the **Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal**. 
    
    > Note: You must have an active Microsoft 365 license that offers the benefit of automatically applying sensitivity labels.
